# ExpandingCards
The ExpandingCards project is a implementation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that focuses on interactive card expansion. The project consists of five cards, each containing an image and its respective title. Initially, only the first card displays its image and title, while the others are collapsed, revealing only a partial view of their respective images. 

The key interaction involves clicking on a collapsed card. Upon clicking, the selected card expands to reveal its entire content, while simultaneously contracting any previously expanded card. This creates a dynamic and visually engaging experience as users navigate through the cards.
